 GOOD OLD FORM
 Exercise 4 of 8

Forms are important. This exercise will teach you how to process the traditional (non-AJAX) web form.

Write a route ('/form') that processes HTML form input
(<form><input name="str"/></form>) and responds with the value of str backwards.

To handle a POST request, use the post() method which is used the same way as get():

    app.post('/path', function(req, res){...})

Express.js uses middleware to provide extra functionality to your web server.

Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own
request handler.

Middleware provide a large variety of functionality such as logging, serving
static files, and error handling.

A middleware is added by calling use() on the application and passing the
middleware as a parameter.

To parse x-www-form-urlencoded request bodies, Express.js can use urlencoded()
middleware from the body-parser module.

    const bodyparser = require('body-parser')
    app.use(bodyparser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

## HINTS

Here is how we can print characters backwards (just one way to do it):

    req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')

Extended set to true (qs) or false (querystring) determines the parser module.

## NOTE

When creating your projects from scratch, install the body-parser dependency
with npm by running:

    $ npm install body-parser

â€¦in your terminal.

Again, the port to use is passed expressworks to the application as process.argv[2].
